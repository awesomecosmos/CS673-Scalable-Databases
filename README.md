# CS673-Scalable-Databases
Repository for storing code for my MS in Data Science course CS673 Scalable Databases at Pace University.

## Project 1
In this [project](https://github.com/awesomecosmos/CS673-Scalable-Databases/tree/main/Project%201), I analyzed a dataset of my choosing using [SQL](https://github.com/awesomecosmos/CS673-Scalable-Databases/blob/main/Project%201/table_and_query_creation.sql). Specifically, I analyzed the [Data Scientist Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset, and created a local database, created tables, and wrote queries to explore this dataset.

## Project 2
In this [project](https://github.com/awesomecosmos/CS673-Scalable-Databases/blob/main/Project%202/VermaAPythonAssignment1.ipynb), I had to complete some basic Python commands.

## Project 3
TBD.

## Midterm Project
In this [project](https://github.com/awesomecosmos/CS673-Scalable-Databases/blob/main/Midterm%20Project/cs673_midterm_project.ipynb), my [partner](https://github.com/woodskd24) and I analyzed the [Data Scientist Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset, and performed EDA, data cleaning, wrangling, manipulation, etc. in order to answer targeted queries and extract insights from the dataset. We recorded our presentation on this project here: https://youtu.be/z1-39Pkm-2E
