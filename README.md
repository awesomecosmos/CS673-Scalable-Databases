# CS673-Scalable-Databases
Repository for storing code for my Pace University course CS673 Scalable Databases.

## Project 1
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of my choosing using SQL. Specifically, I analyzed the [Data Scientist Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) dataset, and created a local database, created tables, and wrote queries to explore this dataset.
